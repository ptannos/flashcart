## About Flashcart
Flashcart makes studying art history fun and easy. Browse through the Art Institute of Chicago's collection, memorize fun facts about various artworks, and take a quiz when you're ready. 

I started this project while a student at The Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy. The prompt was to create any app we want, as long as it is built using at least one new technology that we never used. I chose GraphQL because I'd wanted to learn it for some time, and decided to create something that shows my love for art history and museums. 

## Try the app!

To run the app, run these commands in two separate terminal windows from the root:
```bash
cd final/server && npm i && npm start
```
and
```bash
cd final/client && npm i && npm start
```
